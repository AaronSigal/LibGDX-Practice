<!--
An example XML file for storing items
items are all a part of an item set, inside of which there can only be one type of item (Item, ItemWearable, ItemConsumable). 
Item types are denoted by the "format" attribute. 0 = item, 1 = itemConsumable, 2 = itemWearable.
Sprite elements contain the path to the sprite for the item. The relative root is the assets folder of the project, so you only need to
give the path from that folder inwards. Don't forget the file extension of the sprite.
