<!-- General:
	An example XML file for storing items
	items are all a part of an item set, inside of which there can only be one type of item (Item, ItemWearable, ItemConsumable). 
	Item types are denoted by the "format" attribute. 0 = item, 1 = itemConsumable, 2 = itemWearable.
	Sprite elements contain the path to the sprite for the item. The relative root is the assets folder of the project, so you only need to
	give the path from that folder inwards. Don't forget the file extension of the sprite. 
	The tier attribut is used to define an items "tier". This value is useful for many things, such as drop rates. The higher, the better/rarer the item.
	For each ID, there can only be one corresponding item. So be careful not to use an ID that's already been taken!

	<!-- Consumables:
		Consumable declerations are more complex than base item declerations. There's many more fields to manage, and more attributes to configure. The good news is that 
		most of the time, these consumables *won't* be written by a person. They will be the product of a random generator. Still though, it may be useful to understand the
		structure of the consumable xml decleration. By this point, a pattern should emerge: all int-values are delcared as attributes in the <item> tag, and all more complex
		values are declared in their own tag within the <item>.
