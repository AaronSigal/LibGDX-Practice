<!-- General:
	An example XML file for storing items
	items are all a part of an item set, inside of which there can only be one type of item (Item, ItemWearable, ItemConsumable). 
	Item types are denoted by the "format" attribute. 0 = item, 1 = itemConsumable, 2 = itemWearable.
	Sprite elements contain the path to the sprite for the item. The relative root is the assets folder of the project, so you only need to
	give the path from that folder inwards. Don't forget the file extension of the sprite. 
	The tier attribut is used to define an items "tier". This value is useful for many things, such as drop rates. The higher, the better/rarer the item.
	For each ID, there can only be one corresponding item. So be careful not to use an ID that's already been taken!
